# Test Command

Execute tests and record results with AI Agent

## Purpose (Goal)
- Verify the correctness of implemented code
- Capture and store raw test evidence
- Generate a structured test report for review
- Provide review notes and improvement points before creating a PR  

## Parameters
- `issue_number` (optional): Issue number. If omitted, uses the most recently processed issue from previous `/issue` command
- `output_path` (optional): Output directory path (defaults to current directory)

## Workflow Position
- This command should be run **after `/dev` (development)** and **before `/pr` (commit and pull request creation)**

## Critical Rules
**⛔ ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION: DO NOT EXECUTE ANY GIT COMMIT COMMANDS ⛔**
- NEVER run `git commit` in any form
- NEVER run `git add . && git commit`
- NEVER suggest or execute commit operations
- All changes MUST remain uncommitted at this stage

---

## Instructions for AI Agent

1. **Determine Issue Number**
   - If `issue_number` is provided: Use the specified issue number
   - If omitted: Look for the most recently created issue document in `docs/issues/*/issue.md`
   - Verify that `docs/issues/{issue_number}/issue.md` exists

2. **Analyze Project Structure**
   - Identify test framework (Jest, Mocha, pytest, etc.)
   - Detect test file locations

3. **Execute Test Suite**
   - **If testable code exists**: Run appropriate test commands based on the framework
   - **If no testable code (documentation, configuration, etc.)**: Skip test execution and proceed to manual review

4. **Record Results**
   - **If tests were executed**: Save raw outputs to `docs/issues/{issue_number}/evidence/`  
     (e.g., `test_output.log`, `coverage.json`, `test-results.json`)
     - **IMPORTANT**: Save to `docs/issues/{issue_number}/evidence/` (root level), NOT `backend/docs/issues/{issue_number}/evidence/`
   - **If no tests were executed**: Document "No automated tests available" with manual review results
   - Create final structured report in `docs/issues/{issue_number}/test.md`
   - **CRITICAL: NO TEST RESULT FALSIFICATION**: Record actual test results only - NEVER create fake or simulated test results

5. **Generate Report**
   - **If tests were executed**: Summarize total tests, passed, failed, and coverage
   - **If tests were executed**: List failed tests with error details
   - **If no tests were executed**: Conduct manual review of deliverables and document findings
   - **Compare Issue Requirements vs Implementation vs Test Results (or Manual Review)**
   - Provide comprehensive **review notes** with improvement suggestions
   - **If tests fail to run or produce no results**: Explicitly document "Tests failed to execute" or "No test results generated" - DO NOT create fake results

6. **Cross-Reference Analysis**
   - Read `docs/issues/{issue_number}/issue.md` to understand requirements
   - Read `docs/issues/{issue_number}/spec.md` to understand specifications
   - Read `docs/issues/{issue_number}/plan.md` to understand planned tasks
   - Read `docs/issues/{issue_number}/dev.md` to understand implementation progress
   - **If tests were executed**: Compare actual test results against planned coverage goals
   - **If no tests were executed**: Compare deliverables against issue requirements through manual review

7. **Handle Failures**
   - Do NOT commit or fix here
   - Document failure causes and suspected issues in `test.md`
   - **If tests were executed**: Identify gaps between issue requirements and test coverage
   - **If no tests were executed**: Identify gaps between issue requirements and deliverables through manual review
   - **If test execution fails completely**: Document "Test execution failed" with error details - NEVER create fake test results

## Output Structure Example

```
docs/
└── issues/
    └── 42/
        ├── issue.md
        ├── evidence/
        │   ├── test_output.log
        │   ├── coverage.json
        │   └── screenshot.png
        └── test.md
```

**IMPORTANT**: Evidence files must be saved to `docs/issues/{issue_number}/evidence/` (root level), NOT `backend/docs/issues/{issue_number}/evidence/`

## `test.md` Template

**For Issues with Testable Code:**
```markdown
# Test Report for Issue #{issue_number}

## Summary
- Total Tests: 128
- Passed: 125
- Failed: 3
- Coverage: 87%
```

**For Issues without Testable Code (Documentation, Configuration, etc.):**
```markdown
# Review Report for Issue #{issue_number}
